# instagram_followers_data
This is a python script that  will allow users too see who is not following them back on instagram!

Steps too use:

1. Download this file
2. Go too instagram and download your following/not following data in json format 
3. Open the data from instagram
4. make sure that the python file is in the same folder as the instagram data (that will be in its own folder)
5. Make sure the following and followers data is named correctly
6. Run it!!

Any troubles with the file may be related to the directory, try playing around with that. Everything else should work smoothly
